## Using Python for Research Course

The present repository is a compilation of all my homeworks made
during the course [Using Python for Research by Harvard](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+PH526x+1T2020/course/), 
offered through [EDX](https://www.edx.org/) platform.

This course goes from basics of Python to Statistical learning. We went through specific libraries for research as numpy and matplotlib, statistical concepts as linear and logistic regression and we were also able to create many different histograms with different purpose.
